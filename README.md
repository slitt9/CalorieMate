## CalorieMate

For my term project in CPSC 210, I would like to create an application that essentially tracks the food you eat, tracks those calories, lets you set a calorie goal, and tells you how many calories you have left to consume to reach that goal. 
I believe my app has potential to be used by a wide variety of people:
- Gymgoers
- Athletes
- People with eating disorders
- Anyone actively trying to track their calories to gain/lose weight
With an extremely simple and user-friendly design, I believe my app can be used by almost anyone. The reason that this project is of interest to me is because managing my weight has always been troublesome for me, and as I am *bulking*, I think it just makes sense for me to create this applicaiton.
