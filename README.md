## CalorieMate

For my term project in CPSC 210, I would like to create an application that essentially tracks the food you eat, tracks those calories, lets you set a calorie goal, and tells you how many calories you have left to consume to reach that goal. 
I believe my app has potential to be used by a wide variety of people:
- Gymgoers
- Athletes
- People with eating disorders
- Anyone actively trying to track their calories to gain/lose weight

With an extremely simple and user-friendly design, I believe my app can be used by almost anyone. The reason that this project is of interest to me is because managing my weight has always been troublesome for me, and as I am *bulking*, I think it just makes sense for me to create this applicaiton. 

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a food item to my daily log and specify the portion size and calories.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the food items I’ve logged for the day.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the total calories I’ve consumed and how many I have left for the day based on my target.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a food item from my daily log if I added it by mistake.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the entire state of the CalorieMate application including my logged food items and calorie goals to a file, so that I can resume tracking my progress at a later time.
- As a user, I want to be able to load the saved state of my application from a file, so that I can continue from where I left off, with all my previous data restored.
